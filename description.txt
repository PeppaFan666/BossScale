Boss Health Scaling is a mod that allowes you to change boss health by any multiple of 0.1, it does not add AI or damage, and is therefor not a difficulty mod.
Known bugs: Upon going below 0.8, instead of going to 0.7, it goes to 0.699999, upon another use 0.599999, and so on.
Coincidently, this bug is why there is no message as to what multiplier you are currently at.
Notes: The tools to use this mod can be crafted anywhere for free.
The multipliers reset after you save and exit, make sure to reenable them if you want to keep the current difficulty.
This was made in a very short period of time and was not extensivly tested, if you find more bugs message me on discord at Peppafan666#2429.
